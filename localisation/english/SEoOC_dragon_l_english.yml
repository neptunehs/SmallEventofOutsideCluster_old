 nep_dragon.1.name:0 "A New Seal Broke"
 nep_dragon.1.desc:0 "Something happened in §YSub Seal 1§!,Observations of black holes have led us to discover some violations of the laws of black hole mechanics.But previous observations have proved that this is an ordinary black hole and does not violate it.It's reasonable to believe that this is also a seal, and it will soon be broke.Maybe it is because we have eliminated the §Yseal evil§!, which caused the seal to broke. Or the procedure left by ancient civilizations, let it broke at this time.As scientists says,§Yseal 1§! may have evolved into a very special wormhole-like celestial body. We may be able to travel to other areas through it,but we don't know where to go. We may need some research to get our ship through it, especially to resist the enormous pressure inside it,after all,this seal still looks like a black hole."

It seems that it's artificial, and it's still in places that we couldn't observe in the past. In front of our fleet is a planet wrapped in a protective shield, and our sensors show that there are several in other galaxies in the cluster. We should unlock the shield to see what is inside and what kind of existence build this "Heptagon"."

 nep_dragon.3.name:0 "Inside the Shield"
 nep_dragon.3.desc:0 "This shield does not seem to be particularly complicated, and our scientists have found a way to unlock it. There should be some Gaia planets in the shield, maybe it would be a good place to be our new colony. In addition, each planet has a strange relic, maybe we spend some money to repair, can make these ancient ruins become some useful facilities?"

 nep_dragon.6.name:0 "New Threat?"
 nep_dragon.6.desc:0 "Scientists' research has no way for us to clarify the origins of these unknown forces. But the search is still useful -- we found out where the unknown forces came out: we found a similar Gennacu on all seven planets. There are unstarted weapons inside. We have modified some of their bio-programs to succeed and make them part of our combat power. But research can only end here, because there are new situations that must be dealt with, the Aemethms system has exploded a powerful energy response."
 nep_dragon.6.a:0 "Let the fleets prepare for the battle--based on past experience, this is not a good situation."
